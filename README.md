# Movie List

This is a simple movie list visualization web app. I've submitted the first version for a junior front-end developer application @ Agenda Edu, in late 2021 (I've landed the job :D). Currently, I'm working on structural refactors to make this project more similar to my current studies and skills, so I can use this in my portfolio.

## Requirements

- Node v18.14.0\
- Yarn v 1.22.19

## Running the project

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Runs all TypeScript checks and builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
