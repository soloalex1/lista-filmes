# Movie List

This is a simple movie list visualization web app that allows the user to search for movies and read their details, such as cast, director, trailers and synopsis. I've submitted the first version for a junior front-end developer application @ Agenda Edu, in late 2021 (I've landed the job :D). 

## Requirements

- Node v18.14.0
- Yarn v 1.22.19

## Running the project

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Runs all TypeScript checks and builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
